<h1 id="devlog-v1"><em>⚙️ devlog v1 [ 2025‑11‑30 ]</em></h1>

<p>-  installed debian bookworm + xfce <br>
  
- compiled vim, staged vundle + custom vimrc <br>
  
- installed zsh, oh my zsh, powerlevel10k & jetbrains mono nerd font <br>
  
- staged build‑essentials, rust via rustup <br>
  
- installed btop on am1i + cm4 <br>
  
- installed mark text for blogging/dev logs <br>
  
- monitored am1i load (23% cpu, 3–4 °c) and cm4 load (50% cpu, 46 °c)</p>

<h1 id="devlog-v1"><em>🔍 insights</em></h1>
<p>- athlon idling at 4 °c vs cm4 at 48 °c. both safe, but wildly different envelopes and understandable regarding btops use of curses on the cm4's cortex a72. <br>
- am1i runs absurdly cold under load. perfect example of its low power usage. <br>
- mark text is extremely nice to use for instant preview markdown; vim is my favourite editor but lacks the ability to render markdown real-time. i will stick to vim for coding and mark text for writing devlogs, blogging and general note-keeping.</p>
