<h1 id="devlog-v4">⚙️ devlog v4 [ 2025-12-03 ]</h1>

<p>- external drive prep: deleting empty 300gb partition, resizing 600gb ntfs<br>
  
- backups staged on dev x64 machine (ebooks, projects, photos, isos)<br>
  
- attaching drive to nas-x64 for final serving<br>
  
- samba config planned for clean shares (ebooks, projects, photos, music, video)<br></p>

<h1 id="devlog-v4">🔍 insights</h1>
<p>- ntfs resize safe under linux tools, but backup essential<br>
  
- static ip discipline makes samba integration trivial<br>
  
- prioritizing irreplaceable artifacts (ebooks, photos, projects) over reproducible media (music, video)<br>
  
- smb.conf will map tidy directories, not a messy drive.<br></p>
